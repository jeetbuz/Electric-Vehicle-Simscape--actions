%% Overview
%
% Battery electric vehicles (BEV) are gaining popularity as the prices of
% battery cells fall and the consumer demand for a clean mobility solution
% increases. The key challenges in their adoption lie in addressing the
% vehicle range anxiety, safety, and the total ownership cost for the
% consumer. Li-ion based batteries and electric drivetrains with permanent
% magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) and/or induction motors power modern BEV
% systems. Modeling and simulation helps you design vehicles that meet the
% desired range on the road and perform under all environmental conditions.
% Virtual design of a BEV platform requires a coupled electro-thermal
% system model for performance evaluation. In this example repository, you
% *learn how to simulate a BEV AWD/FWD model to estimate its on-road range*.
% You also *learn how to size your HV battery pack* to achieve your desired
% range with the vehicle.
