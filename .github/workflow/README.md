# GitHub Actions Workflow Folder

## Description

This folder is used to store workflow definition files
in YAML format for GitHub Actions.
`*.yml` YAML files are used
to automatically perform workflows such as unit tests
in GitHub remote server
when certain actions like push or pull request occur.
`*.yml` files are independent of each other,
and they define isolated workflows separately.
